# Lord of the Dead

# Introduction
This is an experimental attempt at creating a Minecraft mod focused on necromancy.
In reality, this is just an exercise in teaching myself Forge. 
If I like my future results, then I will try to flesh this mod out further.
Right now, I am implementing items that will summon undead mobs (zombies, skeletons, etc).
Also, I will attempt to alter mob behaviors. 

# Todo
- Add durability to necromancer staff
- Alter mob behavior to prevent summoned mobs attacking the summoner
- Replace placeholder textures
- Add an item to summon skeletons (uses bones instead of rotten flesh)
- Add new blocks 
- Implement proper functionality for tomes
