# Lord of the Dead

# Introduction
This is an experimental attempt at creating a Minecraft mod focused on necromancy.
Right now I am just teaching myself how to mod with forge, so do not expect anything grand
at this stage. If I like my future results, then I will try to flesh this mod out further.
Right now, I will implement an item that will summon undead mobs (zombies, skeletons, etc).

# Todo
- Add durability to necromancer staff
- Alter mob behavior to prevent summoned mobs attacking the summoner
- Replace placeholder textures
- Add use for grave robber shovel
